Status : filters resources using keywords, orders them by the selected attribute, has color codding for poor/good/very good, shows percent of caps, shows past (with keywords only search to limit the number) or available as well, has pagination (10 rows by default).

How to use 
Fill in keywords in the input field like "nab,woo,hide" and chose an attribute for ordering (ex. OQ), you get back all "Naboo Wooly Hide" ordered by quality.
Very usefull before using resource crates. If no keywords are used it just shows all the currenlty available resources.


Tested on Firefox

Purpose is to create a basic resource browser interface that doesn't require additional work (like filling values in GH or feeding xml in there every x days)
